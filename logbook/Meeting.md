Today we discussed more about the project with my supervisor Pelin. Previosuly, I had a rough idea about the project upon which I had made earlier that was in doc folder. However, we beat out the idea and data access for the  project. The main notes from the meeting were:

* General introduction to HiCAP methods :-  HiCAP methods are based on the interaction of promoter and enhancer interactions. A lot of lab based steps generates a lot of interactome data from Athereosceloris patients.  
* Data :-  2 individual patients based HiCAp data was generated
* Basically the structure of data consists of 2 information --> one based on the  promoter anchored gene information and other information of genomic coordinates of putative enhancers. 
* Defination of Common and Rare variants: In order to define the common and rare variants, we followed the defination of <1% in general population. Upon discussion, we used swedish frequency dataset.
* The datasets were transferred to folder BAV in UPPMAX folder /pica/v8/b2016173/INBOX  /BAV_HiCap
* General plan was 
    * Extract rare varaints that would overlap the genomic interval
    * Functional annotate these variants (TFBS)
    * In case of rare variants we have already interactome information of  associate these genomic interval with genes
    * Extract potential informative genes from these genes.
